# shallow_learning_lung_cancer
Contains code repeating the results from "Limited Incremental Prognostic Value of Multiplex Immune Cell Densities Beyond Clinical Parameters in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
" (Yet to be published)

Run shallow_learning.py to run the machine learning experiments based on cell densities. 
To compute cell densities from the cell phenotypes and tissue areas, run prepare_cell_data.py

Run compute_medical_statistics.py to get Kaplan Meier curves and Cox regression forest plots.
